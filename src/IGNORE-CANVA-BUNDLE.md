# ❌ IGNORE THE CANVA JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE

## 🚨 Important Notice

**You do NOT need to upload a JavaScript bundle to Canva.**

## 🤔 Why Canva is Asking for a Bundle

When you created your Canva App (ID: `AAHAAFRb5g8`), you created an **Apps SDK** app.

**Apps SDK** is for building **extensions that run INSIDE Canva** (like custom image filters, data importers, etc.).

**This is NOT what you need for automation.**

---

## ✅ What You Actually Need

### **For Social Media Automation:**

You need the **Canva Connect API** (REST API), which:

- ❌ Does NOT require a JavaScript bundle
- ❌ Does NOT run inside Canva
- ✅ Creates designs via API calls from YOUR server
- ✅ Perfect for automation

**Current Status:** Beta (request access)

---

## 🎯 What to Do Instead

### **Option 1: Skip Canva API Entirely** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**Why:**
- Works TODAY (no waiting for API approval)
- Takes 10 min per design
- 90% automation already achieved

**How:**
1. AI generates all captions (automated)
2. You create designs in Canva (manual, 10 min each)
3. Scheduler auto-posts (automated)

---

### **Option 2: Request Canva Connect API**

**For full automation later (optional):**

1. Go to: https://www.canva.com/developers/connect-api
2. Request access (explain your automation use case)
3. Wait 1-2 weeks for approval
4. Integrate REST API
5. 100% automation achieved
