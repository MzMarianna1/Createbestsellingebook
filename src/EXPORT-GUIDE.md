## 💡 Marketing Copy Suggestions

### Subject Line Ideas
- "Stop homework battles (without bribing or yelling)"
- "Your child isn't lazy. The system missed them."
- "The real reason homework ends in tears every night"

### Sales Page Hook
*"You've tried rewards, consequences, timers, and breaking it into chunks. Nothing works. Because you're treating the behavior—not what's causing it. This isn't a discipline problem. It's a scaffolding problem."*

### Social Media Post
*"If homework ends in tears at your house, your child isn't broken. The system just missed their wiring. 'Stop Homework Battles' shows you exactly what scaffold they need—without yelling, bribing, or breaking their spirit. Link in bio."*
