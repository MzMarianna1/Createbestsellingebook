  63 pages. No fluff. Just the scaffolding protocol that stops nightly meltdowns.

  I'm launching it Monday and offering Founder's Pricing to the first 100 buyers: $47 (regular $67).

  If you know anyone dealing with homework battles, would you share this with them? [link]

  Thanks for supporting me,
  Marianna

  Hi [Name],

  Thank you for being a beta reader for "Stop Homework Battles"!

  It's officially live today. Founder's pricing: $47 for first 100 buyers.

  Would you be willing to share it with anyone who needs it?

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ DON'T:
- Launch without testimonials (wait for beta readers)
- Apologize for selling ("Sorry to bother you...")
- Post once and disappear (consistency wins)
- Spam Facebook groups without providing value first
- Run ads before you have social proof
- Underprice ($27 is too cheap - devalues it)
- Skip the upsell (leaving money on the table)

### ✅ DO:
- Lead with transformation (not features)
- Share customer wins constantly
- Be visible daily for 30 days minimum
- Provide value before asking for sale
- Price at $67-97 (premium positioning)
- Add upsell from Day 1
- Track what's working and double down
