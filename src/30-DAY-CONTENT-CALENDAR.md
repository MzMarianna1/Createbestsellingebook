## 📱 WEEK 1: "The Homework Battle is Real"

### Day 1: Monday - Problem Agitation
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook/TikTok  
**Format:** Carousel (10 slides) or Video (60 sec)

**POST:**
```
3 SIGNS HOMEWORK IS TRAUMATIZING YOUR CHILD

Slide 1: "If you see these 3 things, homework isn't just hard—it's harmful."

Slide 2: Sign #1 - They say "I'm stupid" 
(Even when they're smart. Repeated failure creates shame.)

Slide 3: Sign #2 - Physical symptoms
(Stomach aches, headaches before homework time. Their body is in fight-or-flight.)

Slide 4: Sign #3 - Complete avoidance
(Hiding assignments, "forgetting," lying about homework. Protection mechanism.)

Slide 5: "This isn't laziness. This is trauma response."

Slide 6: "Your child's brain is trying to protect them from re-living failure."

Slide 7: "Standard advice—rewards, consequences, timers—doesn't touch this."

Slide 8: "They need scaffolding, not motivation."

Slide 9: "Take the quiz to discover which scaffold YOUR child needs."

Slide 10: Link in bio → www.MzMarianna.com/quiz

Caption: "Homework battles aren't about effort. They're about safety. When your child's brain associates homework with failure and shame, their nervous system shuts it down. 

The answer isn't trying harder. It's scaffolding differently.

Take the free quiz (link in bio) to discover your child's specific homework resistance pattern + what scaffold they need.

### Day 2: Tuesday - Story/Testimonial
**Platform:** Instagram Story + TikTok  
**Format:** Talking head video (30-60 sec)

**SCRIPT:**
```
"Last week a mom messaged me: 'Homework went from 2 hours of screaming to 30 minutes with zero tears. That was NIGHT ONE.'

What changed? She stopped trying to motivate her son and started scaffolding instead.

Chapter 4 in 'Stop Homework Battles' has the exact protocol she used.

Not vague advice. Step-by-step: what to do when they get home, how to break down tasks, where to sit, what to say.

Want it? Link in bio."

### Day 3: Wednesday - Educational Hook
**Platform:** Facebook Groups (Post in 10+ parenting groups)  
**Format:** Text post with question

**POST:**
```
Question for parents of struggling students:

Does your child shut down when you mention homework?

I'm talking about the blank stare, the "I don't have any," the sudden need to go to the bathroom, the tears before they even look at it.

That's not defiance. That's a nervous system protecting itself from re-living failure.

Here's what most parents don't realize: motivation doesn't fix this. Your child doesn't need to "try harder." They need scaffolding.

I wrote a whole ebook on this (no fluff, just the protocol). But if you want to start TODAY, here's the #1 shift:

Don't ask "Do you have homework?" (their brain hears: "Are you ready to fail again?")

Instead: "Let's take a look together and figure out what needs to happen first." (their brain hears: "I'm not alone in this.")

You're not doing it FOR them. You're lowering the activation energy.

Anyone else dealing with this? What's your biggest homework battle?

**Platform:** Instagram Carousel + Facebook  
**Format:** Educational carousel

**POST:**
```
YOUR CHILD'S HOMEWORK RESISTANCE IS A CODE

Slide 1: "What they DO tells you what they NEED"

Slide 2: If they shut down when instructions are verbal...
→ They need PROCESS scaffolding (visual checklists)

Slide 3: If they melt down after 10 minutes...
→ They need CAPACITY scaffolding (hard stops, breaks)

Slide 4: If they refuse before even looking...
→ They need EMOTIONAL scaffolding (start with easiest task)

Slide 5: If they can't transition between problems...
→ They need EXECUTIVE FUNCTION scaffolding (body doubling)

Slide 6: "Stop treating the behavior. Address the need."

Slide 7: Take the quiz → Get your child's specific resistance pattern

Slide 8: Get the scaffolding protocol → Link in bio

Caption: Homework resistance isn't random. It's a pattern. And the pattern tells you exactly what support your child needs.

### Day 10: Wednesday - Case Study
**Platform:** Facebook + Instagram  
**Format:** Long-form story

**POST:**
```
CASE STUDY: How Jenna Stopped 2-Hour Homework Battles in 48 Hours

Background: 
• 8-year-old son with ADHD
• Homework took 2-3 hours every night
• Tears, yelling, complete shutdowns
• Tried: rewards, consequences, timers, breaking into chunks
• Nothing worked

What changed:
Jenna took my quiz and discovered her son had EXECUTIVE FUNCTION resistance (not emotional, not processing speed).

She implemented ONE scaffold from Chapter 5:

"Body doubling" - she sat in the same room, doing her own work (not helping, not teaching, just existing).

Result:
• Night 1: Homework done in 45 minutes, zero tears
• Night 2: 30 minutes
• Week 2: He started asking her to sit with him
• Month 1: He can work independently for 15-20 min stretches

Jenna's words: "I thought I was enabling him. Turns out I was scaffolding. He just needed my presence to activate his executive function. I can't believe it was that simple."

### Day 11: Thursday - Controversial Take
**Platform:** TikTok/Reels  
**Format:** Hot take video

**SCRIPT:**
```
[Text overlay: "Controversial homework take"]

[Face to camera, confident tone]

"If homework causes more trauma than learning, STOP DOING IT.

I'm serious.

Your job is not to make your child finish homework.

Your job is to protect their relationship with learning.

If homework creates:
• Nightly meltdowns
• Self-hatred
• Family conflict
• Physical symptoms

STOP. Email the teacher. Set a time limit. Do what they CAN do, not what's assigned.

Your child's mental health > homework completion rate.

And before you panic: I have teacher email scripts for exactly this conversation. Link in bio."

FREE TEACHER EMAIL SCRIPT

Copy/paste this if homework has become a crisis:

---

Subject: Homework Modification Request for [Child's Name]

Hi [Teacher],

I wanted to reach out because homework has become a crisis point at our house. [Child's Name] is [melting down/crying/shutting down] and it's affecting their mental health and our family.

I'm not looking to reduce expectations—I'm trying to figure out what support they need to access the work.

Could we try [specific modification] for the next two weeks? For example:
• Hard stop after 20 minutes (send a note with what was completed)
• Odd-numbered problems only to demonstrate mastery
• Dictate answers to me instead of writing

I'll track what's working and report back. I'd love to partner on this.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
