## 💡 Pro Tips

### **2. Match Photo to Mood**
- Social proof → Confident, successful vibe
- Lead magnet → Warm, helpful vibe
- Testimonial → Authentic, real moment

### **3. Test Opacity**
50% is the sweet spot, but test 40-60% depending on photo darkness.

###**4. Make Text BOLD**
If they can't read it while scrolling, it failed.

### **5. One Message, One CTA**
Don't overwhelm. Social proof + free offer + link = done.
